The game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is very simple. Each player picks one of the three objects (usually by making the appropriate hand shape on a count of three!) and these rules are applied to see who has won that round:

Paper Wraps (beats) Rock
Scissors cut (beat) Paper
Rock blunts (beats) Scissors

The challenge of the game is to guess what your opponent will choose and pick the appropriate object to beat them.
People find it quite hard to pick a sequence of perfectly random choices, so any pattern that a player develops could be learned by the opponent and used to win the game. 
That is what happens in this example. As you play, the computer learns the pattern of objects that you are most likely to pick.
